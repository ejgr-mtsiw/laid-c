# laid-c [matrix_in_hdf5_2018_set_cover]
Implementation of the LAID algorithm in C

This branch implements the set cover algorithm as defined by the thesis of João Apolónia [Apolónia, João - Seleção de atributos de dados inconsistentes [Em linha]. Lisboa: [s.n.], 2018. 111 p.]

##Changes
The dataset used are generated using bitarrays, reducing disk and memory requirements for the datasets.

The disjoint matrix is generated by lines (A) and by columns (A<sup>T</sup>).
In the matriz A each line corresponds to an observation and each bit represents an attribute.
If A\[i\]\[j\] = 1, it means that the line i is covered by the attribute j.

In the matriz A<sup>T</sup> each line corresponds to an attribute and each bit represents a line.
If A<sup>T</sup>\[i\]\[j\] = 1, it means the atribute i covers the line j.

This allows us to get the covered lines array for an attribute much faster.

The main algorithm is:

* Read dataset attributes from hdf5 file
* Read dataset
* Sort dataset
* Remove duplicates
* Add jnsqs
* Write disjoint matrix by line (A)
* Write disjoint matrix by column (A<sup>T</sup>)
* Apply set covering algorithm
* Show solution

##Set covering algorithm
* Fill the attributes totals array from the generated disjoint matrix dataset (A)
* LOOP:
  * Select the best attribute (the one that cover most lines) and add it to the solution
  * Get covered lines array from A<sup>T</sup> for best attribute
  * For each newly covered line, remove its contribution from the attribute totals array.
  * goto LOOP
